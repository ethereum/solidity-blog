Friends,

The year is well underway, cherry blossoms have fallen, and [Devcon](https://devcon.org) is quickly approaching!

As announced on-stage at Ethereal last month, Devcon will be returning to Asia in 2019. We hope that you'll join us this October 8th-11th as we come together in Osaka, Japan!

Without further delay, we're excited to reveal new details for this year's gathering.

## TICKETS

Sales for the first wave* of Devcon tickets will go online in mid July, with notice of the exact date and time at least 7 days prior.

Please note that applications for speakers, scholarships and builder and student discounts will be reviewed on a rolling basis. We'll process as many as we can prior to the first wave of ticketing, but if you haven't received notification by the time ticketing opens, we recommend buying a ticket in order to make sure you're able to attend. If you are later approved for a free or discounted ticket, you'll be refunded the difference.

## APPLICATIONS

For aspiring presenters: [applications for talks, workshops and breakout sessions are now available](https://devcon.org/call-for-participation) for those looking to present on stages of all shapes and sizes.

Applications for builder and student discounts, scholarships, sponsors, and press are all live at https://devcon.org! There are additional funding opportunities to support the scholarship program - contact sponsorships@ethereum.org for more information.

## LOCATION

We're also proud to announce that our Devcon venue will be the ATC Hall in Osaka -- a beautiful and modern venue complete with indoor and outdoor space, a direct train stop for quick downtown access, a view of the docks (for those nautically inclined among us) and on-site food and shopping!

Devcon is the only event operated by the Ethereum Foundation, and our team takes great pride in bringing an incredible and always-growing global community together each year. We hope that this year's Devcon will be the best one yet.

While more details are coming soon, please mark your calendars for each of the above dates, and of course for 08-11 October, 2019!

See you in Osaka!

*What is a wave? To ensure tickets are distributed as fairly as possible, we are releasing batches of General Admissions tickets in several intervals --- which we call waves.
