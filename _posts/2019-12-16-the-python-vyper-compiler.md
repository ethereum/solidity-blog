Earlier this year, a preliminary security audit was performed by the Consensys Diligence
team on the python based Vyper compiler.  [You can read the results for yourself here](https://diligence.consensys.net/blog/2019/09/vyper-here-be-snakes/)

I encourage you to read the report yourself, however, there are two main take
aways.

1. There are multiple serious bug in the Vyper compiler.
2. The codebase has a sufficiently high level of technical debt that it's unlikely these issues can be resolved quickly.

The existing maintainers of the python based Vyper compiler are intent on
continuing with development of the project.  We wish them the best of luck.
For those still interested in this project, you can now find it here under the
`vyperlang` github organization.
