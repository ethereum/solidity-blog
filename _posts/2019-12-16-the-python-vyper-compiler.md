Earlier this year, a preliminary security audit was performed by the Consensys Diligence
team on the Python-based Vyper compiler.  [You can read the results for yourself here](https://diligence.consensys.net/audits/2019/10/vyper/).

We encourage you to read the report yourself, however, there are two main take
aways.

1. There are multiple serious bugs in the Vyper compiler.
2. The codebase has a high level of technical debt which will make addressing these issues complex.

The existing maintainers of the Python-based Vyper compiler are planning to
address the issues and we wish them the best of luck.  To continue following
the project, you can now find it here under the `vyperlang` github
organization.
