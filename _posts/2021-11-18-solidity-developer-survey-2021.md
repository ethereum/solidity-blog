Today we launched the [Solidity Developer Survey 2021](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc5iacmGfzHfAAgQK3hQVxIXXKMImYbQ5tzi33BiMwaBvhbFQ/viewform). Please all take 10 mins to participate and let us know your feedback!

It is the second time we are conducting this survey. You can find the results of last year's Solidity developer survey [here](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2021/01/26/solidity-developer-survey-2020-results/). 

## Shape the Future of Solidity üîÆ

The survey helps us to further improve the Solidity language and compiler and shape the future roadmap of Solidity. We can't wait to hear your thoughts on the priotization of new features, what you like and dislike about Solidity and learn about your coding preferences!

Your replies will help the Solidity project understand your needs, the current strengths and weaknesses of the language and will contribute towards establishing development priorities for the future. This will ultimatively result in improving the Solidity developer experience as a whole.

Similar to last year, the survey consists of several chapters:
- Demographics
- Developer Profile
- Solidity Profile
- Solidity Development Experience
- Upcoming Features and Language Design
- Solidity Community

Completing the survey will roughly take 10 mins. You can skip questions you don't want to answer, no question is mandatory. However, please note that of course the more information you share with us the better we will be able to understand your needs and work on further improving Solidity according to your needs.

## Spread the Word ü™Å

Please support us by spreading the word about the survey! Share it on Twitter, your preferred developer forum, in dev chats or directly with your coworkers and developer friends. 

Thanks a bunch!

The results of the survey will be shared on this blog as well as on the Solidity [Twitter](https://twitter.com/solidity_lang) and [Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@solidity) accounts early next year.
