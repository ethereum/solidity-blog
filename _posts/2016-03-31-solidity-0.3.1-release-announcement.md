This release mainly introduces inline assembly ([documentation](https://solidity.readthedocs.org/en/latest/control-structures.html#inline-assembly)). Inline assembly provides a way to write low-level but still well readable code. Together with the coming features of inline library functions and templates, it allows to move much of the development that had to be done in the compiler itself into libraries written in Solidity. In the future, it will be possible to introduce new versatile types that still look like builtins.

**Features:**
- inline assembly

**Fixes:**
- Code generation: array access with narrow types did not clean higher order bits
- Error reporting: error reporting with unknown source location caused a crash

note: The source below cannot be used without the dependent repositories.


A big thank you to all contributors who helped make this release possible!
