Your friendly [Devcon4](https://devcon4.ethereum.org/) planning team, here to answer your top 3 questions:

**1. When’s the next wave of ticket sales?**

Mark your calendars! We plan to release the next wave of General Admissions tickets on **Tuesday, August 7 at 8AM PST**. Anyone who applied for a discount or scholarship should hear back by then, so that if they didn't qualify they can participate in the wave.

**2. Where in Prague will Devcon4 take place?**

We’ll be in the **[Prague Congress Centre](https://www.praguecc.cz/)**! Ticket holders stay tuned for information about discounted rates at nearby hotels.

**3. How can I apply to speak at Devcon4?**

On **Monday, July 30 we will open up our official call for participation**. Start thinking about what talks you want to present, workshops you want to lead, and breakout rooms you’d like to host! We’ll share more information about what that all means on Monday. :)
