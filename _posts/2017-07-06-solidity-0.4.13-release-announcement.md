This is a small bugfix release that fixes several trivial but very annoying bugs that were introduced with 0.4.12. We also deprecate some old features in preparation of the breaking release 0.5.0.

**Features:**
 * Syntax Checker: Deprecated ``throw`` in favour of ``require()``, ``assert()`` and ``revert()``.
 * Type Checker: Warn if a local storage reference variable does not explicitly use the keyword ``storage``.

**Bugfixes:**
 * Code Generator: Correctly unregister modifier variables.
 * Compiler Interface: Only output AST if analysis was successful.
 * Error Output: Do not omit the error type.



A big thank you to all contributors who helped make this release possible!
