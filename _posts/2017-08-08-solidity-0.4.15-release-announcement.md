This is mainly a bugfix release that corrects a problem with the return value of the low-level ``delegatecall`` function and removes some invalid warning messages.

Features:
 * Type Checker: Show unimplemented function if trying to instantiate an abstract class.

Bugfixes:
 * Code Generator: ``.delegatecall()`` should always return execution outcome.
 * Code Generator: Provide "new account gas" for low-level ``callcode`` and ``delegatecall``.
 * Type Checker: Constructors must be implemented if declared.
 * Type Checker: Disallow the ``.gas()`` modifier on ``ecrecover``, ``sha256`` and ``ripemd160``.
 * Type Checker: Do not mark overloaded functions as shadowing other functions.
 * Type Checker: Internal library functions must be implemented if declared.



A big thank you to all contributors who helped make this release possible!
