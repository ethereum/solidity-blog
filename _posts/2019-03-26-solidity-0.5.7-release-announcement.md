This release mainly fixes bugs in the optimizer and in the experimental ABI encoder. For details about the bug, please see the [official announcement](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2019/03/26/solidity-optimizer-and-abiencoderv2-bug/).

Furthermore, this release also allows you to use Yul as a language option (instead of "Solidity") in the [standard-json-interface](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.5.7/using-the-compiler.html#compiler-input-and-output-json-description).

**Important Bugfixes:**
 * ABIEncoderV2: Fix bugs related to loading short value types from storage when encoding an array or struct from storage.
 * ABIEncoderV2: Fix buffer overflow problem when encoding packed array from storage.
 * Optimizer: Fix wrong ordering of arguments in byte optimization rule for constants.


**Language Features:**
 * Function calls with named arguments now work with overloaded functions.


**Compiler Features:**
 * Inline Assembly: Issue error when using ``callvalue()`` inside nonpayable function (in the same way that ``msg.value`` already does).
 * Standard JSON Interface: Support "Yul" as input language.
 * SMTChecker: Show callstack together with model if applicable.
 * SMTChecker: Support modifiers.
 * Yul Optimizer: Enable stack allocation optimization by default if Yul optimizer is active (disable in ``yulDetails``).


**Bugfixes:**
 * Code Generator: Defensively pad memory for ``type(Contract).name`` to multiples of 32.
 * Type System: Detect and disallow internal function pointers as parameters for public/external library functions, even when they are nested/wrapped in structs, arrays or other types.
 * Yul Optimizer: Properly determine whether a variable can be eliminated during stack compression pass.
 * Yul / Inline Assembly Parser: Disallow more than one case statement with the same label inside a switch based on the label's integer value.


**Build System:**
 * Install scripts: Fix boost repository URL for CentOS 6.
 * Soltest: Fix hex string update in soltest.
