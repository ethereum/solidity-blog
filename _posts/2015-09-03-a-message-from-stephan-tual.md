To the wonderful Ethereum Community,

You often heard me say at conferences that Ethereum was not a company, a foundation, an implementation, or an individual. Ethereum is both an idea and an ideal, encompassing the first censorship-resistant network build specifically to enable those who need it the most to safely trade, privately self-organise and freely communicate, rather than relying on the crippled walled garden handed out by the powers that be.

Due to divergence in personal values, Eth/Dev and I have mutually decided to part ways. I of course intend to continue promoting the Ethereum ideals and bring about a world-class, mainstream platform to build a new breed of decentralized applications. From now on, you'll be able to email me at stephan@ursium.com, read my articles and tutorials on <a href="http://blog.ursium.com">blog.ursium.com</a>, or follow me at @stephantual.

I want to thank each and everyone of you for your incredible enthusiasm and passion, helping pioneer what I believe is the most significant piece of software concept the world has ever seen. Your commitment inspired me, and on many occasions helped me keep going through a year and half of incredibly hard work. 

See you very soon,
												
Stephan
