This release fixed a cleanup error concerning the exponentiation operator. It is a bugfix-only release
and does not contain any features. A more detailed description of the bugs fixed can be found
on the [ethereum blog](https://solidity.ethereum.org/2018/09/13/solidity-bugfix-release/).

Note that nightly builds of Solidity currently contain changes unrelated to this bugfix release.



A big thank you to all contributors who helped make this release possible!
