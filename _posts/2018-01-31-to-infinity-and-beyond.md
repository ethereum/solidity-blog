Dear Ethereum community (and wonderful Etherheads!),

Today, January 31, 2018, is my last day as Executive Director of the Ethereum Foundation.

I’m pleased to have been able to guide the Foundation as ED with my fellow directors, team leads, and outstanding group of team members, each of whom has contributed to our current position of strength. Taking the Foundation from what was an early stage startup to one of stability, with the infrastructure and resources to support the changes, improvements and challenges to come was no small feat in blockchain and cryptoland!

We have gone through a lot together to successfully move through several stages of growth in the last 2.5+ years. As a result, the Ethereum Foundation has become stronger, more solid and capable as an organization, entity and leading contributor in both the Ethereum community and the greater world of emergent tech.

Now that the Foundation has successfully launched Frontier, released Homestead and Metropolis-1 (aka Byzantium), and has the resources to continue supporting its mission and related projects, teams and goals, I feel satisfied the critical work I was tasked with has been done so that the next part of the journey may take place as envisioned.

I would like to take this opportunity to urge the community to give the incoming Executive Director and all new team members a warm and open-minded welcome as well as the time needed for organizational changes of this nature.

To my beloved team members, there are no words to express the effect and experience of working with you in the past years. You will forever be a significant part of my life and I will be rooting for you at the Foundation or wherever life takes you as I commence my own new phase.

As I will be taking care of a number of long overdue matters of a personal nature, I would like to ask our community and the media to focus on the exciting forward-looking developments at the Foundation, in the Ethereum community and in the growing global blockchain ecosystem.

I wholeheartedly wish the very best for the Foundation, the new team members and those of us who carry on here as we brave the new world to evolve and shine both together and separately.

Executive Director (August 1, 2015 - January 31, 2018)
