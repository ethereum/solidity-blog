This release fixes a bug that was introduced in 0.5.14 (the previous release). You are only affected if you manually enabled the Yul optimizer (not the regular optimizer) and either used Yul stand-alone or via ABIEncoderV2. For more details, please see buglist.json.

**Bugfixes:**
 * Yul Optimizer: Fix incorrect redundant load optimization crossing user-defined functions that contain for-loops with memory / storage writes.




A big thank you to all contributors who helped make this release possible!
