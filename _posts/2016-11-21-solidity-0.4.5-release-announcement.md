This Solidity release adds [function types](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/types.html#function-types). Use-cases include supplying callbacks for asynchronous or off-chain operations or generic library features (for example map-reduce-style programming). This release also improves the safety of enums and sending Ether to a contract constructor.

**Features:**
- Function types
- Do-while loops: support for a `do <block> while (<expr>);` control structure
- Inline assembly: support `invalidJumpLabel` as a jump label.
- Type checker: now more eagerly searches for a common type of an inline array with mixed types
- Code generator: generates a runtime error when an out-of-range value is converted into an enum type.

**Bugfixes:**
- Inline assembly: calculate stack height warning correctly even when local variables are used.
- Code generator: check for value transfer in non-payable constructors.
- Parser: disallow empty enum definitions.
- Type checker: disallow conversion between different enum types.
- Interface JSON: do not include trailing new line.
