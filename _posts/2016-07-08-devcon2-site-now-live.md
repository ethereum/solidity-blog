The Devcon2 web site is officially live now! You can find it at <a href="https://ethereumfoundation.org/devcon/">https://ethereumfoundation.org/devcon/</a>

Thanks for everyone's interest, proposals, support and enthusiasm. We have an amazing community and are excited to present the first Ethereum Foundation event in Asia.

This year, Devcon2 (September 19, 20, 21) will be a featured conference at the <a href="http://www.blockchainweek2016.org/">International Blockchain Week</a> in Shanghai by Wanxiang Blockchain Labs, the host organization in China.

While Ethereum Foundation's "devcon" is designed to be a conference by developers for developers, any and all who are interested in the research and development of the Ethereum platform, tools, and technologies are welcome to attend!

The site is not just "live" but it is alive; a living document that will evolve and grow to include more details and information as the event gets closer.

Hope to see you there!
