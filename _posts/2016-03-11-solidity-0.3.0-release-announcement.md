This version is synchronized to the Homestead changes on the main Ethereum network and introduces various breaking changes.

BREAKING CHANGES:
- You should not rely on division for literals resulting in a (truncated) integer. This is still the case but will change once we implement fixed point types, i.e. in the future `1/2 == 0.5` will be true, currently we have `1/2 == 0`. Note that this only applies to literals (`(2 + 7) / 2`) and not variables (`x / 2`).
- Library calls now default to use DELEGATECALL (e.g. called library functions see the same value as the calling function for `msg.value` and `msg.sender`).
- Added new keywords `assembly`, `fixed`, `ufixed`, `fixedNxM`, `ufixedNxM` (for various values of M and N), `inline` in preparation for future features.

Features:
- `<address>.delegatecall` is provided as a low-level calling interface for DELEGATECALL

Bugfixes:
- Fixed a bug in the optimizer that resulted in comparisons being wrong.


A big thank you to all contributors who helped make this release possible!
