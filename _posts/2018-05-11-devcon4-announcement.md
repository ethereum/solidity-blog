Přátelé,

Now that we’re well into the year, we know that many of you have started to plan ahead for changing weather, holiday celebrations, and (of course) Devcon!

We’re excited to announce today that Devcon4 will take place in Prague from 30 October - 02 November of this year.

The first iteration of this conference took place in 2014 as a classroom-sized gathering in Berlin called Devcon0. There, the first visions of what Ethereum would come to be were presented to core developers and founding team members.

Four years later, Devcon has become the most anticipated gathering for blockchain application and platform developers, and through it all we’ve worked hard to stay true to our roots.

With the growth of the platform, Devcon has expanded in size from that small first gathering to around 2,000 strong at Devcon3 in Cancun. We expect that this year’s event will be even larger, but while our roots may be greater in number, Devcon’s purpose will still be to serve our global community of Ethereum developers, designers and ecosystem-builders to come together to connect, learn and share with one another.

In the coming weeks, you’ll begin to find information on how to obtain tickets, how to join us as presenters and more at <a href="https://devcon.ethereum.org">https://devcon.ethereum.org</a>. For now though— mark your calendars!

Thank you all for making this community so great, and we look forward to seeing you at an incredible dc⟠ıv in Prague this fall!
