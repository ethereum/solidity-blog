This release features several major and long-awaited changes:

 - It is now possible to access dynamic data (arrays, strings, etc) returned by function calls.
 - You can specify error reason strings for ``revert`` and ``require`` (support by tooling is still pending).
 - We added the global functions ``abi.encode()``, ``abi.encodePacked()``, ``abi.encodeWithSelector()`` and ``abi.encodeWithSignature()`` which expose the ABI encoding functions and each return a ``bytes`` value.
 - Constructors should now be defined using ``constructor(uint arg1, uint arg2) { ... }`` to make them stand out and avoid bugs when contracts are renamed but not their constructors.
 - Some array operations got cheaper, especially the ``push`` function and initialization of memory arrays.



A big thank you to all contributors who helped make this release possible!
