-------------------------

Welcome to Devcon.

We've got a lot to cover, and in this post you'll read about it all! Read closely as we go over transit to the venue from Osaka's airports, the Devcon Venue, the Agenda & Devcon App, and more!

Please bookmark this piece to answer all questions that you may have related to early and on-site registration, experiences around the venue, participating during talks, side/after events and everything else Devcon5.

To kick things off, let's discuss how to get where you're going. 

I. Transit
=======================

Most attendees will be landing soon, and we want to make sure that you're able to easily navigate toward the Devcon venue.

The majority of folks will arrive at Osaka's international airport, Kansai International Airport (KIX). From there,  there are a few easy ways to reach the ATC Hall, or the Cosmo Tower, Hyatt Regency and Quintessa hotels. 

a. KIX to the Venue 
---------------------

#### KIX Airport Limousine Bus to Hyatt Regency Osaka

[The Limousine Bus](http://www.kate.co.jp/en/timetable/detail/NU) is an express-bus just steps from the doors to the airport. There are only two stops before this service drops off at the Hyatt Regency Osaka, which is adjoined to the venue. The bus leaves every half hour and is bound for Osaka Nanko/Universal Studios.

The cost for a ride is JPY1,600 per person (about $15 USD) one way, or 2,800 yen ($26 USD) round trip. Travel time is 50 minutes. Check the time-table here: <http://www.kate.co.jp/en/timetable/detail/NU>

#### Via Metro 

The metro is a low-cost option for getting around any part of Osaka. From Umeda/Honmachi/Shinsaibashi/Namba, take the Osaka Metro Chuo Line to "Honmachi" station, and from Honmachi station, take the Cosmo Square to Trade Center station for about 18 minutes.

From Shin-Osaka, take the Osaka Midosuji Line to Honmachi station, and from "Honmachi" station take the Cosmo Square to Trade Center station for about 18 minutes.

#### Via JR (Japan Rail)

From Tennoji or Osaka station, take the Loop Line to "Bentencho" Station and transfer to the Osaka Metro Chuo Line via Cosmosquare for about 15 minutes and get off at "In front of the trade center" Station. This trip should run about ¥390.

b. ITM to the Venue
---------------------

For those arriving via connection or domestically at Itami Airport (ITM), we recommend the Itami-Airport Limousine Bus, which will quickly bring you to the center of Osaka. From there, connect with Osaka Metro's Chuo Line to reach the ATC Hall.

And for more information on local transit, we're always thrilled by our community taking the lead, and pleased to recommend and share these community resources:

II. Devcon Registration
=======================

a. Early Registration
---------------------

Optionally, skip the line on Day 1 by registering on Monday to receive your wristband and badge!

Date: Monday, October 7th

Time: 2:00 PM - 7:00 PM 

Location: Sakishima  Cosmo Tower 1st floor

b. DOORS OPEN: On-Site Registration
-----------------------------------

Devcon Venue: [ATC Hall 2 Chome-1-10 Nankokita, Suminoe Ward](https://goo.gl/maps/6KDArGdEHBmGSuD89) 

1.  ### Registration "need to know"

-   All lines are equal --- no alphabetical order this year!

-   Before you arrive, you must redeem your code for a ticket QR and download the PDF to your device or print it in advance.

-   Wristbands are required for entry and must be picked up at registration. Do not lose your wristband --- it will not be replaced. 

-   Badges are optional, and can be picked up at the Swag Station in Hall C

-   For all on-chain auction and raffle ticketeers, please ensure that you've redeemed your tickets [here] (https://blog.ethereum.org/2019/09/03/devcon-on-chain-raffle-and-auction-participants/). Staff will be able to assist on-site if needed.

c.  Internet
------------

We know how conference Wi-Fi often feels, so we're trying out a few new things this year. In addition to the standard venue Wi-Fi option, we'll have dedicated connections in each room to help with presentation-streaming and more. Further, if you have an unlocked phone, let our staff know at registration for a gift and some dedicated data (a data-only SIM card valid for the duration of the conference [5 days]) of your very own. 

d. Reserve Swag during the ticketing process? 
----------------------------------------------

We've got you covered, but you'll pick things up a bit later. See the Swag section for more information (Pt. III-B-1-ii)! 

III. Venue & Experiences
========================

a. Welcome to the ATC Hall
--------------------------

Address: **2 Chome-1-10 Nankokita, Suminoe Ward, Osaka, 559-0034, Japan**

The ATC hall is a beautiful and modern venue complete with indoor and outdoor space, a direct train stop for quick downtown access, a view of the water (for those nautically-inclined among us) and on-site food and shopping!

We have a number of unique activities and spaces for everyone to look forward to both inside and outside the main venue, including a packed schedule on stages of all sizes, a wide variety of food options, and other experiences.

Let's start with those experiences! 

b. Inside the Venue
-------------------

### 1. The Incredible Hall C!

#### i. Tabling Teams

Hall C is directly accessible from the main entryway and gathering place of the ATC Hall. Inside you'll find staff and swag from thirty of the Ethereum ecosystem's leading teams. Be sure to visit throughout the conference as well, since many tabling sponsors and groups will rotate after Day 2 of Devcon. 

#### ii. Swag & Sales

Speaking of swag, Hall C is also the place to pick up your pre-ordered swag and more! Did you select your gear during the ticketing process? Head to the Swag Station and present your QR (download separately from your ticket) to redeem for your swag. If you selected a size, we've got it reserved for you. 

Want something more? We've got exclusive designs and add-ons like Devcon hoodies for sale as well. Check those out here: [swag.ethereum.org](https://swag.ethereum.org/collections/devcon5) - use the password "osaka5" ;) 

#### iii. Badge Design, Sticker Station and Food!

Is your badge not yet covered in pastel colored and meme-related stickers? We can help. Last year's Devcon stickers went quickly, so we've reloaded. Head to the back of Hall C to fulfill your sticker dreams, and grab a snack along the way. 

### 2. Decompression Room II

Need to avoid eye contact? Take the elevator to Floor 6 and find a relaxing, refreshing space for guests to doze and laze about. No devices please! On Day 4, there will be a meditation session led by a Zen monk for those in dire need of a boost after a long conference.

### 3. Dogfooding, Another Kind of Food

#### i. Ethereum Galaxy (Burner Wallet Game) 

Come play Ethereum Galaxy, a webapp scavenger hunt where you can discover all the stars in the Ethereum community's night sky, built by FlexDapps. Collect stars by visiting all areas of the conference scanning QR codes, and complete a whole galaxy to win prizes and the ultimate easter egg.

#### ii. Proof Of Attendance Protocol (POAP)

Snag your collectible ERC-721 token to prove your attendance at Devcon!

### 4. Crypto Grows on Trees

'On the Revitalization of Nature' is an art/thought experience produced and curated by the Department of Decentralization. Through compelling art projects (many of which use the technologies that we are so hard at work on such as Plasma, IPFS and others) we seek to activate the emotional attachment we feel towards our planet and spark thoughts on the current climate crisis. Participants are invited to share their ideas, questions and complaints in a traditional "Complaints Book" which will be later used on a second iteration of the show.

### 5. Elsewhere 

Step through a portal, leaving the hustle and bustle behind, and into an interactive theater exhibit that is Elsewhere. At the entrance you'll find a relaxing, refreshing space for guests to take a deep breath and decompress. Visit Celo's listening booth, flip pages through especially excellent books, chat with friends over a cup of tea while clearing your head. Further in, an artful and interactive experience exploring the veiled concepts with which we mythologize money will lead you on a journey unlike any other.

To find "Elsewhere", take elevator #2 (left of Hall B) to the 3rd floor and head to Umier Cube/Room 308:

![Devcon Venue- Inside](https://blog.ethereum.org/img/2019/10/devcon5-venue-inside.png)

c. Outside the Venue
--------------------

### 1. Devcon Park

We can't wait for you to see the backyard! Devcon Park overlooks the water from the back of the Devcon Venue, and is built by our friends at [ConsenSys](https://consensys.net/). Enjoy seating, food, drink and great views. 

### 2. Devcon Park Amphitheater

Need some air? Check out the cool outdoor amphitheatre area for more talks, panels and workshops. This space also has some free blocks of time if you'd like to schedule your own talk! Just head on down and pencil it in. We'll provide an update here soon with details on how to schedule time using the Scheduler!

Oh... and we have a special guest joining us on Day 1 that you won't want to miss.

###  3. Teatime with Doge

![Doge with Ethereum Hat](https://blog.ethereum.org/img/2019/10/dogethereum.jpg)

Meet Kabo-chan. 

She's fluffy, cute, and you may know her better as the real-life face of Doge. That's right, the pup that started it all is here in the fur and will be giving you the latest on breakthrough state-channel research. Ok, we're kidding about that last part. 

Join Kabo-chan on Day 1 (October 8th) at 2:30PM for teatime and selfies. 

d. Food is an experience, too!
------------------------------

Attendees will have a few more options this year when it comes to the menu. 

Pastries and coffee with a local flare will be around each morning, and light snacks (+coffee and tea) are provided throughout the day. For lunch, everyone will be provided with a stack of vouchers at registration which can be used to get yourself a lunch at [any of the locations listed here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1WWk_XnNY6lPkgFKCFzKJwpyE6f8t2KvgolOpACadpTo/).

In total, we have nearly 30 dining options in and around the venue to let everyone find and pick their favorites each day.
