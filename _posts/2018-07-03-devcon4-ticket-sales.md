Friends,

Today, we’re happy to announce some significant updates to the Devcon4 website, and with it we wanted to unveil a bit about the ticketing and discount processes and more!

Applications for scholarships and builder & student discounts are **now open**!

-   Are you a **builder** working for yourself or a small organization? Apply for a builder discount here: [https://devcon4.ethereum.org/apply/builder-discount](https://devcon4.ethereum.org/apply/builder-discount)
-   Are you a **student** excited to learn about blockchain & Ethereum? Share your proof of enrollment to receive a student discount here: [https://devcon4.ethereum.org/apply/student-discount](https://devcon4.ethereum.org/apply/student-discount)
-   Do you need financial support to attend Devcon4 in Prague? See if you are a match for one of our **scholarships** here: [https://devcon4.ethereum.org/apply/scholarship](https://devcon4.ethereum.org/apply/scholarship)
    
We hope that expediting this process for builders, students, and potential scholars prior to the release of general tickets will help fast-track approvals and ensure that Devcon grows more diverse, accessible and equitable, even with increased demand.

Then on **July 9, 2018**, the first wave* of general tickets will go on sale.

To ensure that tickets are not bulk-reserved, or scooped up by the quickest hands, we ask for your support in respecting a limit of one ticket per person and 20 tickets per organization.

To stay tuned for future Devcon4 updates: sign up for the Devcon4 mailing list on the site and follow our new [@EFDevcon Twitter account](https://twitter.com/EFDevcon)!

We look forward to making this year’s Devcon the best yet!

<small>*What is a *wave*? To ensure that the majority of tickets are reserved for the builders we design Devcon for, we are selling small batches of General Admissions tickets in several intervals — which we are calling waves. The first wave will begin at 8am PDT on July 9, 2018. However, applications for scholarships and developer & student discounts will always be open, regardless of the waves.</small>
