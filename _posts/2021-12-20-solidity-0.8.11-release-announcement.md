[Solidity v0.8.11](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/tag/v0.8.11)
adds a first implementation of a Language Server, allows a safer way to
perform ABI-encoding and fixes several bugs.

## Notable New Features

### Language Server Preview

[Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/)
is an initiative that allows better interoperability between IDEs and
compilers, or more generally, language diagnostics tools. The idea is that
instead of writing a different plugin for each combination of IDEs and
languages, every IDE implements a single client and every compiler implements
a single server and since both of them use the same protocol, you can combine
all of them with each other.

Solidity 0.8.11 contains a first release of an integrated language server,
which means every IDE that has Language Server support will support Solidity
out of the box.

Since we first want to focus on getting the interface right, this release
contains only a minimal set of features: It can only report errors and warnings.

Having said that, we expect future features to be finished quickly. In the first
quarter of 2022 we will probably have "jump to definition", "rename", "find all references",
"show documentation on hover", "semantic highlighting" and more.

Unfortunately, the one feature that will take more effort is the one you were
probably looking forward to the most: autocomplete. The reason is that
autocomplete requires the compiler to perform symbol lookup and type resolution
inside broken (because it is incomplete) code. We have a prototype that can handle
incomplete code, but we do not yet know how useful it is.

#### How to Use the LSP

How to hook your IDE up with the Solidity LSP of course depends on your IDE.
The LSP is currently only implemented for the native binary (i.e. it does not
work if you install Solidity via javascript / npm). You need to download
the binary and provide the path to your IDE, plus the option ``--lsp``.

**QtCreator:** Choose Tools -> Options -> Language Client. Click on "Add" and
provide the path to the solc executable and ``--lsp`` as options.

**vim / neovim:** You need the ``coc`` plugin and add the following to the
``coc-settings.json`` file:

```
{
    // ...
    "languageserver": {
        // ...
        "solidity": {
            "command": "/path/to/solc",
            "args": [ "--lsp" ],
            "rootPatterns": [".git/"],
            "filetypes": ["solidity"]
        }
    }
}
```

**VS Code:** TODO

#### Please Provide Feedback!

Which of the future features would you find most important?
Does the LSP work for you?
Is it easy to install?
Are you working on a plugin or an IDE that would profit from the Language Server?

### ``abi.encodeCall``

It is a common pattern to use ``abi.encodeWithSelector`` to create the
call data for a funciton call which is then performed only later on,
for example in multi-signature wallets or more complex delegate contracts.

The problem with ``abi.encodeWithSelector`` is that the compiler does not
check whether the supplied values actually match the types expected by the
called function.

Because of that, we added ``abi.encodeCall`` which is similar to
``abi.encodeWithSelector``, just that it does perform these type checks:

``abi.encodeCall(contractName.functionName, (arg1, arg2, arg3))`` is the same as
``abi.encodeWithSelector(contractName.functionName.selector, arg1, arg2, arg3)``,
with the difference that the compiler checks that the types of ``arg1``, ``arg2``, ``arg3``
are compatible with a call of the form ``contractName.functionName(arg1, arg2, arg3)``.
