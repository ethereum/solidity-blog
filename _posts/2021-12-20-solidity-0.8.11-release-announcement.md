[Solidity v0.8.11](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/tag/v0.8.11) ...

## Notable New Features

### Language Server Preview

[Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/)
is an initiative that allows better interoperability between IDEs and
compilers, or more general, language diagnostics tools. The idea is that
instead of writing a different plugin for each combination of IDEs and
languages, every IDE implements a single client and every compiler implements
a single server and since both of them use the same protocol, you can combine
all of them with each other.

Solidity 0.8.11 contains a first release of an integrated language server,
which means every IDE that has Language Server support will support Solidity
out of the box.

Since we first want to focus on getting the interface right, this release
contain only a minimal set of features: It can only report errors and warnings.

Having said that, we expect future features to be finished quickly. In the first
quarter of 2022 we will probably have "jump to definition", "rename", "find all references",
"show documentation on hover", "semantic hilighting" and more.

Unfortunately, the one feature that will take more effort is the one you were
probably looking forward to the most: autocomplete. The reason is that
autocomplete requires the compiler to perform symbol lookup and type resolution
inside broken (because it is incomplete) code. We have a prototype that can handle
incomplete code, but we do not yet know how useful it is.

- How to use it
- How to give feedback (which feature most important?)

### abi.encodeCall

- manual calls and especially delegatecalls are very common
- much safer encoding
