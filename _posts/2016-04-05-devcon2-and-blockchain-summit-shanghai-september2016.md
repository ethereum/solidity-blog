[Last update: July 5, 2016]

The Ethereum Foundation and Wanxiang Blockchain Labs are excited to jointly announce the International Blockchain Week in Shanghai, which will take place at <a href="http://www.shanghai.bund.hyatt.com/en/hotel/home.html" target="_blank">Hyatt on the Bund</a>, September 19–24, 2016. Both Ethereum’s Devcon and Wanxiang Blockchain Labs’ Global Blockchain Summit were sold out last year with great interest and anticipation for this year’s events. Now, people who wish to attend both events can do so in the same week.

The combined event features a unique three-segment format that allows people to attend any combination of days that best addresses their needs. Two new features include a Demo Day (by Blockchain Labs) for startups and investors, and an optional day of organized sightseeing tours on September 18, 2016, the day before the commencement of the week's events. [July 5, 2016 note: If organized sightseeing will be offered, this Blockchain Week offering would appear on the Wanxiang Blockchain Lab's event pages]

There are many reasons this combined event may be one of the most anticipated industry events to date. Importantly, the format and versatility of the event will allow greater interaction and opportunities for attendees to communicate, meet and participate across event segments. Developers are already planning to attend or participate in sessions in other segments, and industry leaders involved in blockchain tech are planning to attend some Devcon days as they have done in the past.

For attendees who will be making their first trip to China, Shanghai is both a global financial hub and home to many of Asia’s blockchain pioneers, where the blockchain community continues to grow and is eager to share what China has to offer the greater ecosystem. Serendipitously, since January 30, 2016, short trips to China are now facilitated by a new 144-hour visa-free transit policy that allows travelers from 51 countries or regions to transit in Shanghai for up to a maximum of 144 hours (six days) without holding a visa. However, it may still be easier to get a visitor's visa. I found <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Travel-g294211-c188665/China:Visa.Free.Transits.html" target="_blank">this explanation of China's TWOV</a> (Transit without Visa) policy to be useful.

The format for the 6-day International Blockchain Week in Shanghai will be as follows:
<h3>Devcon2: Days 1-3 - September 19, 20, 21</h3>
Ethereum’s Devcon2 will debut in Asia with the support of its co-host and event partner, Wanxiang Blockchain Labs. Devcon2 will continue to feature Ethereum developers who will introduce, present, and discuss the latest work and related considerations and topics of interest in Ethereum research and development.
<h3>Demo Day: Day 4 - September 22</h3>
Co-hosted by Wanxiang Blockchain Labs and ChainB, one of China’s leading blockchain news agencies, Demo Day will consist of presentations by some of the most accomplished blockchain-enabled companies in the world. This event will be of particular interest to investors, venture capital firms, and start-ups.
<h3>Second Global Blockchain Summit: Days 5-6 - September 23, 24</h3>
Hosted by Wanxiang Blockchain Labs, this segment of the conference will consist of panels and talks by blockchain pioneers and industry leaders. Discussions will focus on addressing current and future business use cases, economic and social impacts, as well as how blockchain technology may be utilized and deployed for trade and other industries.

Xiao Feng, Executive Director of Wanxiang Holdings, says: "China Wanxiang Holding is very excited that we have had the opportunity to contribute in the process of making Shanghai the international financial and technological innovation center with the support from Wanxiang Blockchain Labs. I firmly believe this year's International Blockchain Week in Shanghai will further promote the technology in China, provide an opportunity for sharing knowledge between countries, building a stronger relationship between talents, and encouraging the use of blockchain technology in start-ups. China Wanxiang Holding will continue to support Wanxiang Blockchain Labs with the goal of becoming an internationally recognized platform for blockchain innovation."
