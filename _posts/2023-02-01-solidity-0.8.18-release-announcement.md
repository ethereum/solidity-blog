Introducing the Newest Version of the Solidity Compiler!
We are excited to announce the latest release of the Solidity Compiler, [Solidity v0.8.18](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/tag/v0.8.18). 
This latest version includes a range of improvements and it also introduces support for the [Paris upgrade](https://blog.ethereum.org/2022/08/24/mainnet-merge-announcement)!

### Compiler Features

* No CBOR metadata
    - ``` example code ```
* The support to the Paris hard fork includes: 
* Deprecation of global `block.difficulty` and removal of `difficulty()` in inline assembly for EVM versions >= Paris. The change is due to the renaming and semantic changes of the `difficulty` instruction introduced by [EIP-4399](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4399).
* Introduction of global `block.prevrandao` in Solidity and `prevrandao()` in inline assembly for EVM versions >= Paris.

*Note*: `block.difficulty` is planned to be completely removed in Solidity version `0.9.0`.
