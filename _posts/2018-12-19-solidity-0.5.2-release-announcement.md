This release of the Solidity compiler includes several performance optimizations. These include faster compilation time but also cheaper contracts in some situations. This version also checks for all instances of uninitialized storage references, has some improved error messages and other checks.

You can now create complete contracts in Yul through the support of the Yul object format and the special functions ``datasize``, ``dataoffset`` and ``datacopy``.



A big thank you to all contributors who helped make this release possible!
