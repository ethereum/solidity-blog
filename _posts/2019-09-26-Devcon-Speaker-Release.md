Devcon season is finally here. Days from now, Devcon participants from across the world will begin to make their way to Osaka, and as we approach the final countdown, we’ve made number BIG online releases at [Devcon.org](https://Devcon.org)! 

We invite everyone to meet the incredible and large class of Devcon presenters! Now online here, we’re welcoming speakers, Workshop and Lightning Talk participants and other presenters to Devcon5. All in all, XXX speakers will be a part of the program this year, making this the largest class of Devcon participants ever!

Next, the Ethereum Foundation is excited to announce this year’s Devcon Sponsorship and Scholarship supporters. Leaders from across industries have lent overwhelming support to the Ethereum community, and we’re pleased to have them join us. Meet the teams at Devcon.org, and in Hall C in Osaka (leave room in those suitcases for swag)! 

Finally, we know that everyone’s been most eager to see the release of the Devcon5 Schedule, and we’re thrilled to say that today is the day!

This year’s schedule will be available in multiple formats. Beginning now, the official online release is live at Devcon.org/URLHERE 

An on-the-go schedule will be available through our Devcon mobile app, which this year has been built by the team at Ackee. Through the app, you’ll be able to X, Y, Z. It’ll be very helpful when the desktop version is hard to reach. Such options, wow.  

With just a few days until Devcon, keep posted here to the [EF Blog](https://blog.ethereum.org/) and to [@EFDevcon](https://twitter.com/EFDevcon) for the latest news and updates, and we’ll see you in Osaka!
