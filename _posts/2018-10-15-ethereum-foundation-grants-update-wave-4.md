Greetings from the Ethereum Foundation Grants Team!

As we go full steam ahead to Devcon 4, we're back to announce Wave 4 of the Grants Program! Thank you to all the fantastic community members that have applied with creative ideas on how to bolster our ecosystem. We would not exist without the time and energy that you put into Ethereum. While the program continues to grow, we will increasingly continue to involve more community members in the decision making process. The Grants Program today is vastly improved from just earlier this year, thanks to all the helpful feedback from the community, allowing us to provide better public tools and infrastructure.

If you haven't heard of us before, our last announcement went into some depth on program history, funding summary, and processes. Find that post [here](https://blog.ethereum.org/2018/08/17/ethereum-foundation-grants-update-wave-3/), and you can see guidelines and more [here](https://app.tettra.co/teams/ethereum/pages/applying-for-ef-grants).

Without further ado...
