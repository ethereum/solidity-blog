ÂêÑ‰Ωç,

With well under three months to go until Devcon, we are moving at full speed toward Osaka!

You'll hear about first programming details and more in the coming days, and with ticket sales now underway, we thought it time for a more formal update!

First, Wave 2 of ticket sales are tentatively scheduled to take place on August 6th. We've learned and patched a lot following the last round. We used a new, open source ticketing platform this year, and while the platform itself performed admirably, we didn't get everything right on our configurations for the first production run. With a larger allotment online and a refined checkout process, we hope that everyone experiences a smooth purchasing process in Wave 2.

A change was also made this year to limit tickets to two per order rather than one, so while we do expect Devcon to sell out, those that are online in time can reserve space for coworkers, friends or family.

Next, if you came up with a brilliant idea for a Devcon talk the day after submissions closed, you're in luck.

Applications have reopened today, and they will be available at Devcon.org for one week, July 29 - August 4. This applies to Builders, and Speakers of any kind (Breakout, Workshop, or Presenter), and Students. Scholarship applications have fully closed.

For speakers, this second window was planned with you in mind. We're aware of the speed at which things can develop in the Ethereum ecosystem, and we didn't want to miss out on any recent discoveries!

Finally, all Devcon apps are being reviewed on a rolling basis. The application process is designed to be fair and thorough. Each application is reviewed by at least two people, before a final decision is made by the core Devcon planning team. We think it's really important to have a system in place that ensures that there is no single reviewer who decides the fate of an application - and that takes time.

While not all applicants will be notified at once, everyone will receive a decision by mid-August -- including those applying in the late application window (29 July - 4 August) -- to ensure that everyone has received notice prior to the final ticketing wave (in case participation in the wave is needed to attend Devcon). So if you have already submitted a talk proposal, there's no need to do anything more.

Tl;dr: **Wave 2 is tentatively scheduled to take place on August 6th. Speaker, builder and student application pages are up on[  devcon.org](http://devcon.org/) from July 29 to August 4**. After that, they're gone and they won't come back!

Each day brings us a bit closer to Osaka, and we can't wait to have so many in the Ethereum family together again. We wish you the best of luck with all applications and ticketing, and hope to see you there.
