[Solidity v0.8.5](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/tag/v0.8.5) allows conversions
from ``bytes`` to ``bytesNN`` values, adds the ``verbatim``builtin function to inject
arbitrary bytecode in Yul and fixes several smaller bugs.


## Notable New Features
### Bytes Conversion

This release introduces the ability to convert ``bytes`` and ``bytes`` slices to fixed bytes types ``bytes1`` / ... / ``bytes32``.
In case a byte array is longer than the target fixed bytes type, it will be truncated at the end:

```solidity
function f(bytes calldata c) public view returns (bytes8) {
	return bytes8(c); // If c is longer than 8 bytes, truncation happens
}

If the array is shorter than the target fixed type, it will be padded with zeros at the end:

```solidity
function f(bytes calldata c) public view returns (bytes8) {
	require(c.length == 30, "");
	bytes32 b = bytes32(c); // c is 30 bytes long, so b will be padded with two zero bytes at the end
	return b;
}
```

A nice example of using the `bytes` conversion feature would be its application in proxies:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0
pragma solidity ^0.8.5;
contract Proxy {
	/// @dev Address of the client contract managed by proxy i.e., this contract
	address client;
	constructor(address _client) {
		client = _client;
	}
	/// Forward call to "setOwner(address)" that is implemented by client
	/// after doing basic validation on the address argument.
	function forward(bytes calldata _payload) external {
		// Since ABI decoding requires padded data, we cannot
		// use abi.decode(_payload[:4], (bytes4)).
		bytes4 sig =
			_payload[0] |
			(bytes4(_payload[1]) >> 8) |
			(bytes4(_payload[2]) >> 16) |
			(bytes4(_payload[3]) >> 24);
		bytes4 sig = bytes4(_payload[:4]);
		// Due to truncating behaviour, bytes4(_payload) performs identically.
		// bytes4 sig = bytes4(_payload);
		if (sig == bytes4(keccak256("setOwner(address)"))) {
			address owner = abi.decode(_payload[4:], (address));
			require(owner != address(0), "Address of owner cannot be zero.");
		}
		(bool status,) = client.delegatecall(_payload);
		require(status, "Forwarded call failed.");
	}
}
```

the [documentation on explicit conversions](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.5/types.html#explicit-conversions)


### ``Verbatim``in Yul

Details in the [documentation](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.5/yul.html#verbatim).

This release introduces the set of `verbatim` builtin functions for Yul that allows you inject
arbitrary bytecode into the binary. This is currently only available via pure Yul, i.e., it is not
accessible via inline assembly.

This essentially has two use-cases (more on those below):
1. the use of opcodes unknown to Yul (because they are only proposed or because you are targeting an EVM-incompatible chain)
2. generation of specific sequences of bytecode that are unmodified by the optimizer

The functions are `verbatim<n>i_<m>o("<data>", ...)`, where
- `n` is a decimal between 0 and 99 that specifies the number of input stack slots / variables,
- `m` is a decimal between 0 and 99 that specifies the number of output stack slots / variables,
- `data` is a string literal that contains the sequence of bytes.

Note that there are some caveats when it comes to using `verbatim`. Details about it can be found in
the [documentation](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.5/yul.html#verbatim).

#### Using new Opcodes

As a practical example, one can use this to conveniently inject a newly proposed EVM opcode into the
binary. Take the proposed `BASEFEE` (at `0x48`) opcode (see [EIP-3198][1] and [EIP-1559][2]), since
the Solidity compiler currently does not support this opcode, one can use `verbatim` to implement it
in Yul.

```Yul
{
	function basefee() -> out {
		out := verbatim_0i_1o(hex"48")
	}

	sstore(0, basefee())
}
```

Here's another example that has an input parameter for `verbatim`.

```Yul
let x := calldataload(0)
// The hex"600202" corresponds to EVM instructions:
// PUSH 02 MUL
// That is, it multiplies x by 2.
let double := verbatim_1i_1o(hex"600202", x)
```

The above code will result in a `dup1` opcode to retrieve `x` (the optimizer may directly use the
result of the `calldataload` opcode, though) directly followed by `600202`. The code is assumed to
consume the (copied) value of `x` and produce the result on the top of the stack. The compiler then
generates code to allocate a stack slot for `double` and store the result there.

#### Use-Case for Optimism

The second use-case can be useful for Layer-2-solutions like Optimism, but also other situations
like bytecode analysis or debugging come to mind. Optimism currently uses a custom Solidity compiler
because they simulate the execution of a smart contract where every change to the state
(storage, external calls, etc.) is not executed directly, but it is replaced by a call to
a manager contract that stores the change for verification. The problem with this is checking
whether or not a contract conforms to these restrictions (i.e. properly calls the manager contract
for each change), especially since this has to be done by the on-chain fraud detection mechanism.
What they do is that they check that none of the state-changing opcodes is used by the contract, with the
exception of the ``call`` opcode that calls the manager contract. For this exception to be
properly detected, the sequence of opcodes that leads to this ``call`` opcode has to have a specific
form and usually, the Solidity optimizer does some rearranging and destroys this form.
Luckily, ``verbatim`` can solve this problem such that Optimism does not need to rely on a custom
Solidity compiler anymore and can use all later versions of the Solidity compiler without modifications.

The optimism compiler could take the Yul code generated by the Solidity compiler, append the following
Yul helper functions and syntactically replace all state-changing builtin function calls
with their ``ovm_``-counterparts. For example, all ``sstore(x, y)`` calls are relpaced by
``ovm_sstore(x, y)`` calls. After this replacement, the Yul optimizer can even be run again.
(This code only illustrates ``sstore``.)

```Yul
/// Generic call to the manager contract.
function ovm_callManager(arguments, arguments_size, output_area, output_area_size) {
	verbatim_4i_0o(
		hex"336000905af158600e01573d6000803e3d6000fd5b3d6001141558600a015760016000f35b",
		arguments,
		arguments_size,
		output_area,
		output_area_size
	)
}

// Call a manager function with two arguments
function ovm_kall_2i(signature, x, y) {
	// Store touched memory in locals and restore it at the end.
	let tmp_a := mload(0x00)
	let tmp_b := mload(0x20)
	let tmp_c := mload(0x40)
	mstore(0, signature)
	mstore(4, x)
	mstore(0x24, y)
	ovm_callManager(0, 0x44, 0, 0)
	mstore(0x00, tmp_a)
	mstore(0x20, tmp_b)
	mstore(0x40, tmp_c)
}

// Replace all calls to ``sstore(x, y)`` by ``ovm_sstore(x, y)``
function ovm_sstore(x, y) {
	// The hex code is the selector of
	// the sstore function on the manager contract.
	ovm_kall_2i(hex"22bd64c0", x, y)
}

```


## Full Changelog

### Language Features:
 * Allowing conversion from ``bytes`` and ``bytes`` slices to ``bytes1``/.../``bytes32``.
 * Yul: Add ``verbatim`` builtin function to inject arbitrary bytecode.

### Compiler Features:
 * Code Generator: Insert helper functions for panic codes instead of inlining unconditionally. This can reduce costs if many panics (checks) are inserted, but can increase costs where few panics are used.
 * EVM: Set the default EVM version to "Berlin".
 * SMTChecker: Function definitions can be annotated with the custom Natspec tag ``custom:smtchecker abstract-function-nondet`` to be abstracted by a nondeterministic value when called.
 * Standard JSON / combined JSON: New artifact "functionDebugData" that contains bytecode offsets of entry points of functions and potentially more information in the future.
 * Yul Optimizer: Evaluate ``keccak256(a, c)``, when the value at memory location ``a`` is known at compile time and ``c`` is a constant ``<= 32``.

### Bugfixes:
 * AST: Do not output value of Yul literal if it is not a valid UTF-8 string.
 * Code Generator: Fix internal error when function arrays are assigned to storage variables and the function types can be implicitly converted but are not identical.
 * Code Generator: Fix internal error when super would have to skip an unimplemented function in the virtual resolution order.
 * Control Flow Graph: Assume unimplemented modifiers use a placeholder.
 * Control Flow Graph: Take internal calls to functions that always revert into account for reporting unused or unassigned variables.
 * Function Call Graph: Fix internal error connected with circular constant references.
 * Name Resolver: Do not issue shadowing warning if the shadowing name is not directly accessible.
 * Natspec: Allow multiple ``@return`` tags on public state variable documentation.
 * SMTChecker: Fix internal error on conversion from ``bytes`` to ``fixed bytes``.
 * SMTChecker: Fix internal error on external calls from the constructor.
 * SMTChecker: Fix internal error on struct constructor with fixed bytes member initialized with string literal.
 * Source Locations: Properly set source location of scoped blocks.
 * Standard JSON: Properly allow the ``inliner`` setting under ``settings.optimizer.details``.
 * Type Checker: Fix internal compiler error related to having mapping types in constructor parameter for abstract contracts.
 * Type Checker: Fix internal compiler error when attempting to use an invalid external function type on pre-byzantium EVMs.
 * Type Checker: Fix internal compiler error when overriding receive ether function with one having different parameters during inheritance.
 * Type Checker: Make errors about (nested) mapping type in event or error parameter into fatal type errors.

### AST Changes:
 * Add member `hexValue` for Yul string and hex literals.
