[Solidity v0.7.5](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/tag/v0.7.5) adds the ability so select the ABI coder via ``pragma abicoder v1`` and ``pragma abicoder v2`` and introduces ``--experimental-via-ir`` which compiles through Yul intermediate representation.

## Notable New Features

### Yul Intermediate Representation (experimental)

ADD SOMETHING HERE

New option ``--experimental-via-ir`` allows switching compilation process to go through the Yul intermediate representation. 


## Full Changelog

### Language Features: 
* Ability to select the abi coder using ``pragma abicoder v1`` and ``pragma abicoder v2``.
* Immutable variables with literal number values are considered pure.

### Compiler Features:
* Command Line Interface: New option ``--experimental-via-ir`` allows switching compilation process to go through the Yul intermediate representation. This is highly experimental and is used for development purposes.
* Standard JSON: New option ``settings.viaIR`` allows the same switch as ``--experimental-via-ir`` on the commandline.
* Command Line Interface: Report error if file could not be read in ``--standard-json`` mode.
* Command Line interface: Report proper error for each output file which could not be written. Previously an exception was thrown, and execution aborted, on the first error.
* SMTChecker: Add division by zero checks in the CHC engine.
* SMTChecker: Support ``selector`` for expressions with value known at compile-time.
* SMTChecker: More precise analysis of external calls using ``this``.
* Command Line Interface: New option ``--model-checker-timeout`` sets a timeout in milliseconds for each individual query performed by the SMTChecker.
* Standard JSON: New option ``modelCheckerSettings.timeout`` sets a timeout in milliseconds for each individual query performed by the SMTChecker.
* Assembler: Perform linking in assembly mode when library addresses are provided.

### Bugfixes:
* Command Line Interface: Reject duplicate libraries in ``--libraries`` option instead of arbitrarily choosing one.
* Command Line Interface: Fix write error when the directory passed to ``--output-dir`` ends with a slash.
* Code generator: Fix missing creation dependency tracking for abstract contracts.
* SMTChecker: Fix lack of reporting potential violations when using only the CHC engine.
* SMTChecker: Fix internal error on conversion from string literal to byte.
* SMTChecker: Fix internal error when using tuples of rational literals inside the conditional operator.
* SMTChecker: Fix internal error when assigning state variable via contract's name.
* SMTChecker: Fix incorrect counterexamples reported by the CHC engine.
* SMTChecker: Fix false negative in modifier applied multiple times.
* SMTChecker: Fix internal error in the BMC engine when inherited contract from a different source unit has private state variables.
* SMTChecker: Fix internal error when ``array.push()`` is used as the LHS of an assignment.
* SMTChecker: Fix CHC false positives when branches are used inside modifiers.
