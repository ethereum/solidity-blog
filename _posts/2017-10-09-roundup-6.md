<span style="font-weight: 400;">Metropolis is finally (almost) here! The fork for Byzantium, the first and larger part of Metropolis, succeeded on the testnet over two weeks ago, and the likely date for the fork on the mainnet has been set to block 4.37 million, which is expected to be on Oct 17. New features include opcodes such as REVERT and RETURNDATACOPY, as well as precompiles that can be used to support a wide array of cryptographic algorithms. At the same time, we have been seeing many improvements to Ethereum core code, Whisper, Swarm as well as Ethereum’s future scaling plans.</span>

 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://github.com/ethereum/pyethereum/pull/809"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Casper PoC4</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has been released. This includes an implementation of the fork choice rule, the Casper contract, and a complete pyethereum library, though not yet a full node that can connect to the network.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A “</span><a href="https://github.com/karlfloersch/pyethereum/blob/develop_hybrid_casper/ethereum/tests/hybrid_casper/test_chain.py#L108"><span style="font-weight: 400;">testing language</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” has been implemented that allows us to quickly implement tests for the Casper chain. This can also theoretically be used for the proof of work chain, and an extension to sharding is in progress.</span></li>

 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The number of message types in Casper FFG has been <a href="http://ethereumresearch.trydiscourse.com/t/casper-ffg-with-one-message-type-and-simpler-fork-choice-rule/103">reduced from 2 to 1</a>, which will also simplify the incentive structure. A formal proof of the safety property <a href="https://github.com/pirapira/pos/blob/master/CasperOneMessage.thy#L424">has been written</a>. This will be incorporated in PoC5.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">The fork choice rule has also been simplified.</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">Pyethapp now supports python 3.</li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;">The "scalable light client data availability verification" note has been <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/research/wiki/A-note-on-data-availability-and-erasure-coding">edited with an improved scheme</a></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The research team has added one full-time new developer and one part-time to Viper, and there is an increasing number of community contributors. Features being worked on include:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://github.com/ethereum/viper/pull/335"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cross-contract ABI calling</span></a></li>

</ul>
<b>cpp-ethereum</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We are making progress with syncing to the test and main networks. Now cpp-ethereum can </span><a href="https://github.com/ethereum/cpp-ethereum/pull/4291"><span style="font-weight: 400;">import warp snapshot </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">and continue syncing from the snapshot block.The Byzantium implementation has been finished. Since the last roundup:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://github.com/ethereum/cpp-ethereum/blob/develop/doc/database_layout.rst"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Documentation on DB layout was added</span></a></li>

 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several deadlock and </span><a href="https://github.com/ethereum/cpp-ethereum/pull/4386"><span style="font-weight: 400;">race condition</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bugs were fixed</span></li>

Tracing is still missing though. See the </span><a href="https://github.com/ethereum/evmjit/blob/c7a351c3a52875a384ff9c13241965256e765ae1/include/evm.h"><span style="font-weight: 400;">evm.h</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> header file.</span></li>
</ul>
<b>Geth</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the last roundup, Geth saw a </span><a href="https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/releases/tag/v1.7.0"><span style="font-weight: 400;">major release (v1.7.0)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and a follow up </span><a href="https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/releases/tag/v1.7.1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">maintenance release (v1.7.1)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with primary focus being on the upcoming Byzantium hard fork (enabled for all networks as of v1.7.1).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to Byzantium, a few features finalized (some of which you may have seen in the </span><a href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2017/09/14/geth-1-7-megara/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">v1.7.0 Megara blogpost</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">):</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">EVM log storage and indexing was </span><a href="https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/14631"><span style="font-weight: 400;">completely reworked</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, cutting the filtering time of the entire chain for contract events by 2-3 orders of magnitude, from minutes to under a second.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The base peer-to-peer protocol used by all Ethereum sub-protocols was updated to use </span><a href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/706"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snappy compression</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, cutting the bandwidth needed for a fast sync </span><a href="https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/15106"><span style="font-weight: 400;">from 33.6GB to 13.5GB</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and similar reductions are expected for day-to-day operational bandwidth requirements too. Since operational bandwidth relies on updated peers, its effect will become visible in the longer term.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rinkeby was extended with an authorized signer and a bootnode </span><a href="https://blog.infura.io/infuras-signer-and-bootnode-on-rinkeby-440de6f70961"><span style="font-weight: 400;">courtesy of the INFURA team</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which should both help find peers faster, as well as provide a stabler experience due to the excess available bandwidth capacity on the test network.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Some important features we’re currently working on (but might take a bit of time due to Devcon preparations) includes:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/14952"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generational disk </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">writes</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to keep the recent trie modifications in system memory and only periodically store checkpoint tries. This feature greatly speeds up processing batches of blocks as well as significantly reduces final consumed disk space. However there are still some minor roadblocks to solve to ensure we don’t break sync for remote nodes due to the new data availability pattern in the network.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A new variation of fast sync that does not download the entire state-trie node-by-node, but rather only pulls trie leaf nodes (along with supporting Merkle proofs), and assembles the final trie locally, which should have a huge impact on the number of network packets required to do the initial sync. That said, besides implementing it, this feature needs proper benchmarking to support it and an EIP process to debate its inclusion as the next version of the `eth` protocol.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Version 5 of the DEVp2p discovery protocol (currently experimental and used by the light clients) to enable it to run concurrently with v4 on the same UDP port, as well as to iron out the kinks noticed from running the light client on top.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Version 2 of the light client protocol, based on the new bloombits filtering mechanism, which will finally allow light clients to retrieve and subscribe to EVM events. The new version should also support tracking transactions for chain inclusion without the overhead of downloading entire blocks just to verify their transaction contents.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Research into an ultra-light mode of operation where clients connect to a set of user defined backing servers similar to the classical client-server model, but where the node can cryptographically cross-validate the multiple backends to prevent them from cheating.</span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A plethora of bugfixes have also been merged into both releases, which you can skim through at the GitHub milestones for </span><a href="https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/milestone/47?closed=1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">v1.7.0</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/milestone/56?closed=1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">v1.7.1</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Testing</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Test cases for Byzantium are ready and some clients passed all of them. After the last round up, we:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://github.com/ethereum/tests/pull/213"><span style="font-weight: 400;">introduced JSON schema checking</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This ensures more stable formats of the testing suite, and prevents accidental typos in field names.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://github.com/ethereum/cpp-ethereum/pull/4341"><span style="font-weight: 400;">separated inputs and outputs of doTests() functions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Before this PR, typos in the input files were copied into the output files.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://github.com/ethereum/cpp-ethereum/pull/4382"><span style="font-weight: 400;">applied `const` attributes on inputs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and now the output files only contain fields that were explicitly added.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">c</span><a href="https://github.com/ethereum/cpp-ethereum/issues/4392"><span style="font-weight: 400;">onsolidated options of testeth</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://github.com/ethereum/cpp-ethereum/pull/4375"><span style="font-weight: 400;">added more graceful error handling in testeth</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Replaced log entries in the test files with a keccak hash of the log RLP.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">opened </span><a href="https://github.com/ethereum/cpp-ethereum/pull/4468"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a fix</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that will remedy some unwanted side-effects where translation of GeneralStateTests into BlockchainTests destroys the originals.</span></li>
</ul>

<b>Yellow Paper</b>

&nbsp;

<a href="https://github.com/ethereum/yellowpaper/issues/229"><span style="font-weight: 400;">All Byzantium changes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have been documented on pull-requests. The next issue to address is the treatment of the empty account states on precompiled contracts, where different clients do different things. </span><a href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/716"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A GitHub issue</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was created to discuss this.</span>

<b>Formal Verification</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">@pirapira gave talks at the </span><a href="https://yoichihirai.com/cambridge2017.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ARM Research Summit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and at </span><a href="https://yoichihirai.com/tuberlin.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">TU Berlin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We Implemented </span><a href="https://github.com/pirapira/rlp-ocaml/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">RLP in OCaml</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, available with opam install rlp.</span>

<b>Bamboo</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We started</span><a href="https://github.com/pirapira/bamboo/pull/195"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> writing a specification</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. External interfaces are </span><a href="https://github.com/pirapira/bamboo/pull/192"><span style="font-weight: 400;">being implemented</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

<b>EVM 1.5</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Solidity assembly can now handle </span><a href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/615"><span style="font-weight: 400;">EIP #615</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> opcodes for subroutines and the rest, thanks to Alex.  Initial implementations of both EIP #615 and </span><a href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/616"><span style="font-weight: 400;">EIP #616</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are written, and reviewed by Andrei, and testing has begun.  Greg is working to present initial performance measurements at Devcon.</span>

<b>web3.js</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">web3.js 1.0 beta received a great deal of community contributions which is exciting as it appears 1.0 is already being used a lot in the wild. Please be careful using the account generation and signing, as it has not been audited. Those accounts should not hold any significant amount of ether. We are currently at beta.22. If everything goes well, we hope to have a 1.0.0 Release candidate by Devcon3.</span>

<b>web3.py</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Web3.py recently added features and improvements including:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Release of the </span><a href="http://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/middleware.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Middleware API</span></a></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reworking of the testing infrastructure to test against go-ethereum, pyethereum, and py-evm.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bugfixes and API improvements for the web3.eth.sign and web3.sha3 APIs as well as progress towards a unified approach to how different string encodings are handled.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Experimental </span><a href="http://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/providers.html#ethereumtesterprovider"><span style="font-weight: 400;">integration</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with the </span><a href="https://github.com/pipermerriam/ethereum-tester"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ethereum-tester library</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
</ul>
<b>py-evm</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Development continues to progress, moving us closer to an early alpha release, which will allow running py-evm as a light client.</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Implementation of the basic DevP2P networking API.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Journaling for state database changes.</span></li>
</ul>
<b>Ethereum Tester</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ethereum Tester is a new tool for python developers design to provide a standard API for testing applications that interacts with the EVM. The library uses a pluggable backend system that allows swapping out the underlying VM implementation. This library can also be used transparently with web3.py by using the </span><a href="http://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/providers.html#ethereumtesterprovider"><span style="font-weight: 400;">experimental EthereumTesterProvider</span></a>

<b>Remix</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Two very important PRs has been pushed recently: (1) a terminal that allows tracking transactions and interacting with web3, and (2) a revamp of the UI.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We are now fixing bugs and helping the community to adjust to this new GUI.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A number of new features are being worked on for release in the coming weeks:</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">- </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Highlight of declarations and references, basic autocomplete and renaming</span>

<b>Solidity</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We are close to finishing the </span><a href="https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/2863"><span style="font-weight: 400;">new ABI en/decoder</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> using the iulia language. This allows passing structs and arbitrarily nested arrays across function calls. It is also a little stricter when it comes to invalid input data including </span><a href="https://github.com/Arachnid/uscc/tree/master/submissions-2017/martinswende"><span style="font-weight: 400;">invalid array lengths</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. You can use ``pragma experimental ABIEncoderV2;`` to activate it. With a similar statement, ``pragma experimental “v0.5.0”;`` you can activate upcoming breaking changes, which we are adding one after the other. You can now use ``</span><a href="https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/2473"><span style="font-weight: 400;">f.selector</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">`` to access the selector (also called the “function hash”) of a function. Using the default visibility of a function will generate a </span><a href="https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/2749"><span style="font-weight: 400;">warning</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> now, and should make you aware of </span><a href="https://github.com/paritytech/parity/commit/e06a1e8dd9cfd8bf5d87d24b11aee0e8f6ff9aeb"><span style="font-weight: 400;">unintended public functions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Finally, Solidity is </span><a href="https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/2848"><span style="font-weight: 400;">warning</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about (and more strictly </span><a href="https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/2904"><span style="font-weight: 400;">enforcing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> if you opt to already activate v0.5.0 features) violations of “view” (formerly called “constant”) and “pure” annotations for functions. After Byzantium, a call to a “view” function will use the new </span><a href="https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/2966"><span style="font-weight: 400;">STATICCALL</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> opcode and thus enforce the “view” aspect of the function at VM level.</span>

<b>Mist</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Released version 0.9.1: </span>

&nbsp;
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Merged the light client feature as an experimental option</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Updated electron, geth and solidity to enhance security</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A new core developer </span><a href="https://github.com/marcgarreau"><span style="font-weight: 400;">@marcgarreau</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> started working on refactoring state management in Mist using Redux</span></li>
</ul>
<b>Security</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A cross-language differential fuzzer of operations on the alt_bn128 elliptic curve, which are required to perform zkSNARK verifications, in three different clients (Parity, Geth and CPP), in order to find discrepancies between these implementations, has been built. Driven by the libFuzzer engine, the program autonomously creates inputs that lead to new code paths in any of the implementations. In addition to that, it validates that the output of each implementation for any input is the same.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Based on this work, a fuzzer that tests the Parity and Geth implementations of the EVM for equivalence is being developed.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We have been continuing cross-EVM fuzzing efforts in order to find discrepancies between EVM-implementations (Geth, CPP and Parity), and have doubled the bounty rewards for bugs related to consensus or denial-of-service (geth). </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The hive-testing framework has been updated to test four clients (geth, cpp, py, parity) with the new Byzantium tests. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">An external audit of Mist is in the final stages, and an RCE-vulnerability has been patched and released (credits to Yoonho Kim via the bug bounty program). We </span><b>strongly </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">recommend updating to the most recent version of Mist!</span>

<b>EthereumJS</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the last roundup, several new contributors have stepped in to assist with development.  EthereumJS is now passing most Byzantium state and blockchain tests. The development effort continues with general bug fixes and code refactoring. The most notable of these efforts is a refactor of the library to add support for JavaScript big integers.</span>

<b>Swarm</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The swarm team merged important new updates and additions into master including the network </span><a href="https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/14982"><span style="font-weight: 400;">testing and simulations framework for p2p</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with </span><a href="https://github.com/ethersphere/swarm/wiki/sim-frontend"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a 3D visualiser</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, improved scheduling for breaking up and reassembling data -- the </span><a href="https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/14382"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pyramid chunker</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with the new </span><a href="https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/14334"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Binary Merkle Tree  chunk hash</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which brings  compact inclusion proofs verifiable on the blockchain, and </span><a href="https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/14967"><span style="font-weight: 400;">improved more informative error messages</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The network layer rewrite (our major features for POC3) has completed the first phase and pss v1.0 is dev ready now with diffie hellman key-exchange and continually updated keystream.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our team is engaging in ever more community cooperation to develop certain features on our roadmap by allowing external contributors to feel part of the wider team. </span><a href="https://github.com/ethersphere/swarm/wiki/Working-groups"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are launching 5 working groups about </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">5 of our most relevant subprojects: network simulation, pss node to node messaging, media and data streaming, database services and the swap swear and swindle framework for incentivizing bandwidth sharing and long-term storage of data. The latter is now gaining momentum as the third orange paper is being worked on with the draft version first to be presented on </span><a href="https://www.meetup.com/ethereum/events/242548678/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">11th October in the London Ethereum Meetup</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We just published the tentative program for Devcon3 breakout session on p2p technology and the blockchain (10:30am-4:30pm, 4th November, 2017).</span>

<b>Whisper</b>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A new core developer @gballet started working on fixing Whisper v5 and updating the documentation.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">v5 message delivery was broken by a slew of updates over the summer; fixes have been made and will be integrated soon.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">EIP 627 is finalized and implementation will begin shortly.</span></li>
