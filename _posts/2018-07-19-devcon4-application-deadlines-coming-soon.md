Přátelé.
Just a quick update today!
 
Applications for sponsorships, scholarships, student discounts and builder discounts will be up until **11:59PM PST on July 24th**. 
 
After that, there will no longer be a way to submit an application for these tracks. Please note that if you've already submitted an application or do so before the deadline, it will be processed and responded to by the Devcon team in short order!
 
As we continue to work toward providing everyone an opportunity to attend Devcon, we’re capping applications in preparation for future waves and to give the general public the chance to join us! 
 
We look forward to receiving your applications soon, and to seeing you in Prague!
 
Děkuji,
