[Solidity v0.8.12](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/tag/v0.8.12)
improves the javascript/wasm binary and fixes several bugs.

## Notable New Features

### Emscripten Build / solc-js

We were able to reduce the size of the Javascript / WebAssembly
binaries from 27 MB to just over 8. The reason for the large binary
in the first place is that we include the SMT solver Z3.

The size reduction is achieved by compressing the binary using LZ4 and
decompressing it when it is loaded, which should be completely transparent to the user.
We were initially worried that this might have a negative impact on people who
switch compiler versions often or always run it in a fresh nodejs environment,
but our benchmarks show that the decompression is faster than the base64 decoding,
so it should not be an issue.

### Typescript migration of solc-js

The code for the javascript wrappers of the compiler has been partially
ported to TypeScript, which should have no impact on users of the npm package.
If you build the package yourself or use the repository without the npm package,
please contact us if you encounter any problems.
