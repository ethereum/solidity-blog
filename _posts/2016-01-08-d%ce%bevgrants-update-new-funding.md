If <a href="https://devcon.ethereum.org/">DEVCON1</a> proved anything in spades, it was certainly the enthusiasm, creativity, and momentum of the Ethereum developer community. Utilizing the never-before-seen potential unleashed by the Ethereum World Computer, our small-but-growing community is not *just* re-imagining money (or even *just* re-imagining the Internet)... It is also re-imagining and delivering alternative models for re-organizing the very fabric of our society around a more transparent and inspectable "stack".

ÐΞVgrants <a href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/04/07/devgrants-help/">came into existence</a> on April 7, 2015, in order to ease some of the natural burdens of developing the lower-level tools which will hopefully further the above scenario. At DEVCON1, I presented a very short talk summarizing the projects funded up to this point, as well as presenting a special announcement concerning continued funding.
<h3>Omise's Donation</h3>
The good news is that ÐΞVgrants isn't over, because we now have $100K USD of additional funds to work with through the new year, thanks to a generous donation by <a href="https://www.omise.co/">Omise</a>.
<blockquote>"We are honored by the opportunity to support the decentralization revolution, beginning with our contribution that will restart the Ethereum ÐΞVgrants program." – Jun Hasegawa, Omise CEO</blockquote>
It is our hope that this donation will encourage both potential funders to come forward and support ÐΞVgrants and related endeavors, just as much as it may encourage potential applicants. We thank Jun and Omise for their gesture of good will in the space.

<h3>In conclusion</h3>
Providing grant funding to the developers of brilliant, platform-level Ethereum projects has resulted in a flourishing of important new work, in turn enabling and accelerating higher-level developments for others to build upon. With this highly successful experiment once again open for business, please, look over your projects and give thought to what components benefiting everyone, might also benefit from a grant.

Comments and questions may be directed to me at <a href="mailto:wendell@ethereum.org">wendell@ethereum.org</a> or our <a href="https://gitter.im/devgrants/public">Gitter</a>. As before, interested parties may also follow <a href="http://twitter.com/devgrants">@DEVgrants</a> on Twitter for updates about funded projects, evaluation policy changes, etc. A ÐΞVgrants Web site is still on its way, which will have further details about the above project, and our plans.

I'm really looking forward to reading your applications!
