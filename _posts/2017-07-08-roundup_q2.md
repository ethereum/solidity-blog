<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the last month and a half, the Ethereum network went through a rapid growth in usage, to the point that it now processes as many transactions per second as Bitcoin. To accommodate the increased load, which has on a few occasions reached the network’s full capacity for hours at a time, the community independently came together and miners voted to </span><a href="https://etherscan.io/chart/gaslimit"><span style="font-weight: 400;">increase the gas limit to 6.7 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We at the Foundation have been rapidly putting additional resources toward increasing the efficiency of the network, alongside planning longer-term changes that will greatly increase the network’s scalability.</span>
<h3>Research</h3>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Ethereum research team </span><a href="https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/867016629120520192"><span style="font-weight: 400;">came together in Singapore</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and discussed various topics to do with Casper, sharding and Ethereum protocol economics.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A prototype of Casper the Friendly Finality Gadget/Fork Choice Rule in Python is close to being finished: </span><a href="https://media.consensys.net/casper-smart-contract-consensus-7be6cfa6f7ec"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://media.consensys.net/casper-smart-contract-consensus-7be6cfa6f7ec</span></a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIVnhiZKZi8"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIVnhiZKZi8</span></a></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A new version of “the Mauve Paper” is underway and reaching early draft stage, though possibly </span><a href="https://github.com/ethereum/research/tree/master/casper4/papers"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in the form of multiple papers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> discussing specific considerations and categories of attacks</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The pyethereum client has seen a substantial revamp, and version 2.0 has been released. See </span><a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi?:action=display&amp;name=ethereum&amp;version=2.0.4"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://pypi.python.org/pypi?:action=display&amp;name=ethereum&amp;version=2.0.4</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for download; in Ubuntu you can also do “sudo pip install ethereum”. Additionally, we have implemented experimental versions of:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">State tree pruning (reducing disk consumption by over 80%): </span><a href="https://github.com/ethereum/pyethereum/commit/8931e4945348ffa6e21cd77dba23846341056410"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://github.com/ethereum/pyethereum/commit/8931e4945348ffa6e21cd77dba23846341056410</span></a></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">On-disk state cache (makes state reads require one database read instead of O(log(n)): </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://github.com/ethereum/pyethereum/commit/fdfcf69a81a9fec159394db68099d6582201ad6d">https://github.com/ethereum/pyethereum/commit/fdfcf69a81a9fec159394db68099d6582201ad6d</a></span></li>
</ul>
<h3>Metropolis testing</h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Metropolis testing is rapidly moving forward. We are actively seeking additional help with finishing testing. See:</span>

</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We have started a substantial cross-client benchmarking effort to identify places that are in greatest need of performance improvement. See some preliminary results for opcode benchmaking in geth here: </span><a href="https://gist.github.com/holiman/7b157e4074707f6ba3196d46ad3745af"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://gist.github.com/holiman/7b157e4074707f6ba3196d46ad3745af</span></a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ethereum core developer meetings #15-#19 took place. Notes and audio/video of the meetings can be found here: </span><a href="https://github.com/ethereum/pm/tree/master/All%20Core%20Devs%20Meetings"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://github.com/ethereum/pm/tree/master/All%20Core%20Devs%20Meetings</span></a>
<h3>Mist team</h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In May-June, the Mist team had a team meetup: for one week the team had face to </span><a href="https://twitter.com/feindura/status/869695036216266752"><span style="font-weight: 400;">face meetings</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, some members for the first time, in which we sat together to share details on projects we were working on and to talk about the current codebase and future roadmap. While we have a long list of features we are working on, we realized that most of the issues reported on github were related to two main issues: slow synchronization and lost account private keys/passwords. We outlined features that we could implement to help prevent user errors and other related issues, including more options for node switching (including Infura support) and better options for account management (including HD wallets and mnemonic seeds - but with a twist). </span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of those new issues require some changes on how the signing process is done to make Mist more independent of Geth, which is being worked on as a standalone signer. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have also done some research on refactoring parts of the Mist codebase to make it more modular and easier to maintain. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Victor Maia presented some research on how to make apps load quicker and be more reliable and we are currently testing some of these concepts as either pieces of the main codebase and/or an alternative web-based product.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Progress has been made on ENS integration: we have added ENS support to our address component, meaning that any of the apps we have built in meteor (wallet and ens registrar app) will accept a name in any field where it would usually expect an ethereum address. We are also working on making a web component for generic input types for ethereum addresses, so any webapp developer can use an input field with support for ENS, checksum and ethereum identicons. With swarm now using the main net registrar, it also means that Mist will accept ENS addresses on the url as soon as the swarm branch is merged.. </span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swarm integration has been tested and is a lot more stable than it has been even a few weeks ago. We predict it will finally be ready to release soon.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3>Web3.js</h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Web3.js is  coming along well. The new whisper API was recently added to the old 0.x.x and the new 1.0.0 version. Whisper v5 is currently only available in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">geth</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and needs to be started using </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">--shh</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  We are currently adding swarm.js and finishing the JavaScript account management. If everything goes well, an alpha release will happen soon.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can already test the new web3.js 1.0 here: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js/tree/1.0">https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js/tree/1.0</a>, a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nd read the new docs at </span><a href="http://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">http://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/</span></a>
<h3>Security</h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We have received several bounty submissions for vulnerabilities in EthereumJS, Solidity and Cpp-ethereum. See the </span><a href="https://bounty.ethereum.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">leaderboard</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the current stats.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We now have pyethereum on board on the cross-client blackbox consensus testing in Hive, which continuously performs over 10K tests on each client. See </span><a href="http://hivetests.ethereum.org"><span style="font-weight: 400;">http://hivetests.ethereum.org</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. As a lightweight alternative to Hive, we've also started a project to perform fuzz testing directly on the virtual machines, starting with Geth, Parity and Python. In the same vein, we've also set up an automated </span><a href="http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AFL</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">-based fuzzing of Solidity.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In preparation for Metropolis, a benchmarking suite for the Geth EVM has been implemented to ensure that the gas prices for new opcodes and precompiles are within reasonable bounds, so as to not constitute DoS-vectors at a later point.</span>
<h3>EVM 1.5</h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The “EVM 1.5” proposals are now EIP drafts for “Subroutines and Static Jumps for the EVM #615,” and “SIMD Operations for the EVM #616”.  Discussion and critique are welcome at the </span><a href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/615"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/615</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/616"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/616</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> conversations.</span>
<h3>EthereumJS</h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The ethereumJS team is still </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/6kc5g3/ethereumjs_team_is_seeking_contributors/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">looking for community contributors</span> </a><span style="font-weight: 400;">to help the Ethereum Javascript client reach Metropolis compatibility. A video walkthrough “</span><a href="https://youtu.be/L0BVDl6HZzk"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Intro to Core Development with Ethereumjs-vm</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” has been released.</span>
<h3>Light Client</h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">New algorithms have been designed and implemented in order to improve log searching performance in the next version of the LES protocol. Promising R&amp;D work has been done toward achieving quick and trustless initial syncing without hardcoded checkpoints. We have put some efforts into finalizing the topic discovery protocol, which helps clients to find suitable LES servers as it is currently a somewhat weak point in the experimental light client service.</span>
<h3>Remix</h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The main Remix feature in the last month is the alpha release of Remixd: </span><a href="https://github.com/ethereum/remixd"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://github.com/ethereum/remixd</span></a>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remix now allows access to a shared folder from Remix IDE - </span><a href="https://remix.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial_remixd_filesystem.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://remix.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial_remixd_filesystem.html</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are improving the UI interface (Thanks to Nina, Rob!), in progress: </span><a href="https://github.com/ethereum/browser-solidity/pull/604"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://github.com/ethereum/browser-solidity/pull/604</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> - </span><a href="https://github.com/ethereum/remix/issues/520"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://github.com/ethereum/remix/issues/520</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The Contract and Debugger tab are going to be quite nicely improved.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In terms of functionality, the plan is to streamline the way contracts are developed, verified and debugged.  One important feature (that has also been requested) is the ability to interact with web3 from a JavaScript console directly from the IDE. Implementing this feature in progress now (thanks Alex!) - </span><a href="https://github.com/ethereum/browser-solidity/issues/535"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://github.com/ethereum/browser-solidity/issues/535</span></a></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Note that it is already possible to use Remix from Mist, and a lot of anticipated Remix PRs aim to improve this integration.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ENS integration has started - </span><a href="https://github.com/ethereum/browser-solidity/issues/550"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://github.com/ethereum/browser-solidity/issues/550</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, including a number of bug fixes.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3>Formal Verification</h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The progress in the eth-isabelle project was mostly from external contributions. In particular,  the better separation logic tactics, which were externally contributed allow much shorter proofs about Ethereum contracts.</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Better separation logic tactics (contributed)</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coq build fixed, and added in the continuous integration</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Removing unmaintained files, and `Annotation` structure not needed anymore (PR pending)</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Running Blockchain Tests (in progress; ecdsa recover implementation in OCaml wanted).</span></li>
</ul>
<h3>Bamboo</h3>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The compiler is generating bytecode for all initial examples</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Syntax perfection following community feedback</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">End-to-end testing of the compiler (in progress)</span></li>
</ul>
<h3>Solidity</h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Solidity project has been quite active in the last months, although most of the updates is not yet directly visible on the user side. We saw a lot more engagement by the community and now have volunteers regularly contributing both to the core code as well documentation including translation, mainly into </span><a href="https://github.com/AdrianClv/solidity-docs-es"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spanish</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We added a feature that allows </span><a href="https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/1810"><span style="font-weight: 400;">export of the full abstract syntax tree</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with all type annotations, which makes it much easier to write tools that would otherwise need a custom-made parser. The next feature will be to also </span><a href="https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/2500"><span style="font-weight: 400;">re-import</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> this data after potential modifications, which would allow things like mutation testing.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We extended the inline assembly language with </span><a href="https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/assembly.html#switch"><span style="font-weight: 400;">structured elements (for, switch and functions)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and deprecated manual jumps. This new inline assembly language will become a new intermediate language (together with type information), which allows Solidity to be more transparent in its compilation, more efficient (we will be able to add much more sophisticated optimizer routines) and more portable (it can already compile to EVM, EVM1.5 and some eWASM). We are currently </span><a href="https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/2433"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rewriting the ABI encoder</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in this intermediate language which will include structs and nested dynamic objects.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, we are adding an </span><a href="https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2274"><span style="font-weight: 400;">automated compile-time overflow and assertion checker</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which will also feature an SMT solver for the more complicated cases. Oh and of course, we have worked on tons of </span><a href="https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/Changelog.md#0412-unreleased"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bugfixes and smaller features</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>
<h3>Swarm</h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The swarm team has onboarded new members and held an in-person Swarm Summit in Berlin in June, 2017. The week-long event brought together Ethereum team members, community contributors andspecial guests representing projects and companies interested in swarm. More than twenty talks and tutorial sessions were recorded. The edited videos will be published soon on the swarm summit website. Our public alpha test saw a great community response allowing us to gather more information on prospective user base needs and what the typical usage patterns might be. The high churn of nodes requires an explicit distinction between nodes that can and cannot commit to being available for a longer period of time to provide sufficient storage and bandwidth resources for the network. To support noncommiting nodes and mobile clients, swarm will offer various light modes of operation.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We have developed a suite of example applications highlighting the architectural and implementational peculiarities of Swarm-hosted distributed web applications that are quite a departure from the traditional client-server model. In particular, the building blocks of a distributed functional equivalent of dropbox are being developed, such as a web-interface providing a file-system view of swarm-hosted volumes, ENS integration, Mist-integration, FUSE mounting of swarm-volumes and privacy protections.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We added a new protocol, pss (bzz whispered) allowing internode messaging with deterministic routing based on the relaying kademlia network topology of swarm. The protocol uses whisper envelopes and offers udp-like protocol communication between nodes that are not directly connected. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, we have developed a network testing and simulation framework in which we can model and benchmark a broad range of scenarios emerging from the interaction of a potentially large number of  nodes. This framework includes both scripting and visualization capabilities.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In cooperation with the Remix team, the implementation of a fully distributed integrated contract development environment is underway.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The next major release, POC 0.3 is scheduled to come out around Metropolis and will include  obfuscation support for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">plausible deniability</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a rewrite of the swap peer-to-peer accounting for bandwidth incentivisation among other things. </span>
