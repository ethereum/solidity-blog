This release contains several new features and bugfixes and also an important security fix: The ``ecrecover`` function can be forced to return invalid data, which can be used to bypass authentication in very special circumstances.

Features:
 * C API (``jsonCompiler``): Export the ``license`` method.
 * Code Generator: Optimise the fallback function, by removing a useless jump.
 * Inline Assembly: Show useful error message if trying to access calldata variables.
 * Inline Assembly: Support variable declaration without initial value (defaults to 0).
 * Metadata: Only include files which were used to compile the given contract.
 * Type Checker: Disallow value transfers to contracts without a payable fallback function.
 * Type Checker: Include types in explicit conversion error message.
 * Type Checker: Raise proper error for arrays too large for ABI encoding.
 * Type checker: Warn if using ``this`` in a constructor.
 * Type checker: Warn when existing symbols, including builtins, are overwritten.

Bugfixes:
 * Code Generator: Properly clear return memory area for ecrecover.
 * Type Checker: Fix crash for some assignment to non-lvalue.
 * Type Checker: Fix invalid "specify storage keyword" warning for reference members of structs.
 * Type Checker: Mark modifiers as internal.
 * Type Checker: Re-allow multiple mentions of the same modifier per function.
