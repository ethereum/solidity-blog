Today we are launching the [Solidity Developer Survey 2020](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdcTPsWxuXmyG74t_zUI4pYQk1Y7mFcz03Owg4wJqrvRh7SsA/viewform?usp=sf_link). It is the first time we share a proper language survey and we hope to turn this into an annual tradition moving forward. 

You might remember the small feedback survey we did this year as part of the Solidity Summit registration in which we asked you for the most liked and dreaded Solidity features. If you're curious to revisit the results of that click [here](https://twitter.com/solidity_lang/status/1258432533286584322?s=20).

## Help shape the future of Solidity üîÆ

So why should you care and take 10 mins of your time to repsond to this survey? Easy: Your replies will help the Soldity project understand your needs, the current strengths and weaknesses of the language and will contribute towards establishing development priorities for the future. This will ultimatively result in improving the Solidity developer experience as a whole.

The survey consists of several chapters:
- Demographics
- Your Solidity Learning Journey
- Your Developer Profile
- The Soldity Developer Experience
- Your Soldity Usage
- Solidity Developer Community

None of the questions are mandatory, if you don't feel like responding to one or more chapters you can skip them. However, please note that of course the more information you share with us the better we will be able to understand your needs and work on further improving Solidity according to your needs.

## Support us by spreading the word üó£Ô∏è

Last but not least, please support us by spreading the word about the survey! Share it on Twitter, your preferred developer forum, in dev chats or with your coworkers and developer friends. 

Thanks a bunch! We will be back with the results in the beginning of next year!
