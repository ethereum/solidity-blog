This release introduces the AST export, solidifies inline assembly, introduces some more warnings and fixes several bugs.

Manual jumps in assembly are deprecated in favour of the structured constructs `switch`, `for` and function calls also to provide better portability in the future.

Features:
 * Assembly: Add ``CREATE2`` (EIP86), ``STATICCALL`` (EIP214), ``RETURNDATASIZE`` and ``RETURNDATACOPY`` (EIP211) instructions.
 * Assembly: Display auxiliary data in the assembly output.
 * Assembly: Renamed ``SHA3`` to ``KECCAK256``.
 * AST: export all attributes to JSON format.
 * C API (``jsonCompiler``): Use the Standard JSON I/O internally.
 * Code Generator: Added the Whiskers template system.
 * Inline Assembly: ``for`` and ``switch`` statements.
 * Inline Assembly: Function definitions and function calls.
 * Inline Assembly: Introduce ``keccak256`` as an opcode. ``sha3`` is still a valid alias.
 * Inline Assembly: Present proper error message when not supplying enough arguments to a functional
   instruction.
 * Inline Assembly: Warn when instructions shadow Solidity variables.
 * Inline Assembly: Warn when using ``jump``s.
 * Remove obsolete Why3 output.
 * Type Checker: Enforce strict UTF-8 validation.
 * Type Checker: Warn about copies in storage that might overwrite unexpectedly.
 * Type Checker: Warn about type inference from literal numbers.
 * Static Analyzer: Warn about deprecation of ``callcode``.

Bugfixes:
 * Assembly: mark ``MLOAD`` to have side effects in the optimiser.
 * Code Generator: Fix ABI encoding of empty literal string.
 * Code Generator: Fix negative stack size checks.
 * Code generator: Use ``REVERT`` instead of ``INVALID`` for generated input validation routines.
 * Inline Assembly: Enforce function arguments when parsing functional instructions.
 * Optimizer: Disallow optimizations involving ``MLOAD`` because it changes ``MSIZE``.
 * Static Analyzer: Unused variable warnings no longer issued for variables used inside inline assembly.
 * Type Checker: Fix address literals not being treated as compile-time constants.
 * Type Checker: Fixed crash concerning non-callable types.
 * Type Checker: Fixed segfault with constant function parameters
 * Type Checker: Disallow comparisons between mapping and non-internal function types.
 * Type Checker: Disallow invoking the same modifier multiple times.
 * Type Checker: Do not treat strings that look like addresses as addresses.
 * Type Checker: Support valid, but incorrectly rejected UTF-8 sequences.
