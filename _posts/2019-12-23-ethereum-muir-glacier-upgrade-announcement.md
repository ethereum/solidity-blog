title: Ethereum Muir Glacier Upgrade Announcement

The Ethereum network will be undergoing a scheduled upgrade at **block number 9,200,000**, which is  predicted to occur on **Wednesday, January 1, 2020**. The exact date is subject to change due to variable block times and timezones.

### **Please upgrade your node before Wednesday, December 30, 2019 to account for the variable block times.**

[Ethernodes.org](https://ethernodes.org) has kindly provided Istanbul node statistics and a countdown timer located at <https://ethernodes.org/muir_glacier>. [etherscan.io](https://etherscan.io/) has provided a countdown timer located at <https://etherscan.io/block/countdown/9200000>. You can monitor the network upgrade in real time at <http://forkmon.ethdevops.io/> (it will be updated shortly before the fork).

# What is Muir Glacier?

Muir Glacier is the name given to this network upgrade. Previous network upgrades have been given other names such as [Istanbul](https://blog.ethereum.org/2019/11/20/ethereum-istanbul-upgrade-announcement/), [Costantinople](https://blog.ethereum.org/2019/02/22/ethereum-constantinople-st-petersburg-upgrade-announcement/), and [Spurious Dragon](https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/11/18/hard-fork-no-4-spurious-dragon/).

# As an Ethereum user or ether holder is there anything I need to do?

If you use an exchange (such as Coinbase, Kraken, or Binance), a web wallet service (such as Metamask, MyCrypto, or MyEtherWallet), a mobile wallet service (such as Coinbase Wallet, Status.im, or Trust Wallet), or a hardware wallet (such as Ledger, Trezor, or KeepKey) you do not need to do anything unless you are informed to take additional steps by your exchange or wallet service.

# As a node operator or miner, what do I need to do?
