<span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re excited to share the results of the first wave of grants from the Ethereum Foundation.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As a reminder, the Ethereum project seeks to support useful dapps and smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, and the goal of the Ethereum Foundation is to empower developers with best-in-class R&amp;D, developer experience, and education. Despite the early promise of the ecosystem, we still have a long way to go, and we are here to work with the community to drive concrete progress.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">These grants will fuel the teams working hard at research &amp; development to support the entire ecosystem. Furthermore, we hope that these grants will signal to the community what we think are the missing pieces in the ecosystem that need more support. Said in another way, the Foundation is here to serve teams and individuals that are working to prevent a tragedy of the commons.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, we will double down on working with the community to make Ethereum scalable, useful and secure. As such, although this grant program was announced two months ago as a </span><a href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2018/01/02/ethereum-scalability-research-development-subsidy-programs/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">strictly scalability-focused program</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we decided to broaden the support to projects that are doing great work across </span><b>scalability, usefulness and security</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. These projects have no ICOs, no token sales, and focus simply on building useful products and experiences.</span>

<b>Scalability</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can be in the form of implementing sharding, plasma or state channels with existing teams or on your own. It can also be in the form of optimizing geth/parity or building alternate clients. </span><b>Usefulness </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">is for improving the developer experience (e.g. static analyzers, linters, dev frameworks, mobile SDKs, documentation, Solidity/Vyper development) or experimenting with new dapps that provide utility to the end user. </span><b>Security</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can range from auditing existing contracts to providing tools that prevent error-prone programming patterns to contributing to alternative second-layer languages that focus on security.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We are also beginning to </span><b>engage with the design community</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help solve product and UX design problems. For example, key management, Ethereum payments UX and onboarding flows are all areas that need major improvement for mainstream adoption. We would like to fund more design studies, hire, and connect talented designers with exciting teams in the space.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Lastly, we would like to remind ourselves of how the Ethereum project began: passionate </span><b>open-source developers</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> contributing to the project on their spare time. In that spirit, we’ve begun a “hackternship” grant for community members that propose an impactful Ethereum side project.</span>
