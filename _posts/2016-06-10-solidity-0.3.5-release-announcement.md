**Features:**
- Context-dependent path remappings (different modules can use the same library in different versions)

**Bugfixes:**
- Type Checking: Dynamic return types were removed when fetching data from external calls, now they are replaced by an "unusable" type.
- Type Checking: Overrides by constructors were considered making a function non-abstract.

note: The source below cannot be used without the dependent repositories.


A big thank you to all contributors who helped make this release possible!
