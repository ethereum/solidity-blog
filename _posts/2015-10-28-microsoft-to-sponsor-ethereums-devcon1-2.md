Marley Gray, Director of Technology Strategy US Financial Services at Microsoft said, "Microsoft is excited to sponsor and attend Ethereum's DevCon1. We find the Ethereum blockchain incredibly powerful and look forward to collaborating within the Ethereum Community. We see a future where the combination of Microsoft Azure and Ethereum can enable new innovative platforms like Blockchain-as-a-Service. This will serve as an inflection point to bring blockchain technology to enterprise clientele".
